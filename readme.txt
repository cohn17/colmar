This project offered many difficulties. 

1) The inconsistent padding between the mobile and the desktop version called for a lot of extra coding for what was purely aesthetics. As such, it was a lot of busy work.

2) The mockups were not to scale, in terms of what was indicated as 16px, 24px, etc.

3) I was unable to line up the bottom of the information section photo with the bottom of the second sidebar photo if I wanted to keep to the specs.

Thank you.
